For this data set, we chose to have the Washington State Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The dataset has a range of 2012 to 2018 and it's collected throughout the Washington state. We believe in the source of the data as it is provided by the state government website. There are two groups in Washington state that has to report this data to the state government: Facilities that annually pollute at least 10,000 metric tons of greenhouse gasses in Washington and Suppliers of liquid motor vehicle fuel, special fuel, and aircraft fuel that supply products equivalent to at least 10,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in Washington.
The reason we chose this data because the issue of climate change has been on the rise recently. With climate change activists being heard all around the world alarming the issues and effects of climate change onto future generations. We believe it's important that we base our claim on data so we know that there are evidences backing them up rather than blindly stating it. With all that said, let's look at the data we've gathered.
This is a summary paragraph. As we can see, the average carbon dioxide emission in 2013 is `r format (summary_info$"Average Co2 in 2013", big.mark = ", ")` MT whereas the average carbon dioxide emission in 2018 is `r format (summary_info$"Average Co2 in 2018", big.mark = ", ")` MT. This is actually a decrease of roughly 10,000 MT, but we won't know for sure if the data set has gotten larger or not. The sector that has the highest emission of Carbon Dioxide here is `r format (summary_info$"County that has max emission of Co2")` County. As for the reporter that has a maximum Total Emissions of Carbon Dioxide, that would go to the `r format (summary_info$"Sector that has max Total Emission")` sector. As we can see in the bar chart below, this sector also comes in second for the average carbon dioxide emissions by sector. Lastly, I tried to find a reporter that has the highest ratio of Carbon Dioxide to Total Emissions of Carbon Dioxide. But I set it to less than 1.0 as that gives a bit of fair advantage to other reporters. Here, the reporter is `r format (summary_info$"Reporter that has max Co2 to Total Emissions Ratio")`.

**AGGREGATED TABLE**

a_table
```
The purpose of this table is to show the total contribution of emission by the different Sectors. It is clearly to see that **Refineries** and **Plup and Paper** industries contribute the most in the State of Washington. With this table one will be able to tell what sectors hurt the environment the most and which sectors are not hurting the environment. The table also shows how much of each kind of pollution these sectors are emitting (Biogenic Carbon Dioxide, Carbon Dioxide, Methane)

# Introduction
The datasets we are using are useful in exploring our domain of interest in the carbon footprint of human activities impacting the environment of the Pacific Northwest. The first dataset is about greenhouse gases in the transportation sector, which is collected by the EPA annually. This dataset shows how much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere per year by different categories (fossil fuels, fluorinated gasses, etc). The other dataset we found important to exploring our domain of interest is about electric vehicles in Washington State, collected by the Washington Department of Licensing. This dataset is important because it has information on the amount of electric vehicles being registered. These datasets are useful in learning how vehicles impact our local environment of the Pacific Northwest, and exploring the idea that changing towards electric vehicles could reduce this impact of carbon emission.
# Summary
## Aggregate Table
```{r echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
source("table-of-summary-information.R")
kable(full_electric_vehicle_population, caption = 'Electric Vehicle in Washington State')
This table containing 5 example rows of data shows how an electric vehicle's range is proportional to its base MSRP (price). However, the data shows that there are diminishing returns as price gets to higher levels.
## First Chart
## Second Chart
```{r echo=FALSE}
library("knitr")
source("second-chart.R")
qplot(Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data$`Model Year`, geom = "histogram", xlab = "Model Year", ylab = "Number of Electric Vehicles", main = "Number of Electric Vehicles by Model Year in Washington State")
This chart has the intention of displaying the number of electric vehicles in Washington state by model year of the vehicles. What is demonstrated is that many more electric vehicles are being produced and purchased in more recent years.
## Third Chart
This [Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data/f6w7-q2d2) was provided by the State of Washington. It contains information about fully-electric and hybrid-electric cars registered in Washington State
