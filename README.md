# Project Proposal

This is where you will create your Github repo for your final project. Instructions are on Canvas!


## Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?
  - Our domain of interest is related to the environment field around the area of Pacific Northwest. We are choosing to observe the carbon footprint of human activities that lead towards greenhouse impacts in our local area. For example, specifically how the automotive or motor-operated vehicles impact our local environment? Could the change towards electric vehicles reduce the impact of carbon emission?. We will make a hypothesis based on the data collected and derive the impact of transportation on the environment over time.
- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

  - One of the data driven projects is the Forest Fire in Pacific Northwest. On the website, they are researching why wildfires around the Pacific Northwest have increased over the years and how the wildfires have changed or developed because of climate change. The data presentation shows the cumulative area burned due to climate change and not due to climate change from 1985 to 2015. In addition, the website presents the fires and climate feed loop which shows how the cycle between wildfire and climate change results in more uncontrollable fires in the future. Nonetheless, the impact to wildlife due to climate changes and bad forest management will result in more displaced wildlife and future extinction.

  - Next, [Inventory of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18140.pdf) is a data driven project where they track the CO2 emissions by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This tracking is necessary in order to improve and initiate more policy in order to reduce the carbon footprints by the Laboratory. The project showed in depth calculations regarding how each sector emitted CO2. The result showed the highest contributor to carbon footprints came from business travel, followed by natural gas consumption, and employees commuting and purchasing electricity.

  -  [Western North American extreme heat virtually impossible without human-caused climate change](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/) is data driven research that is working to find the cause of the recent heatwave in Western North America. The recent extreme heatwave in Pacific Northwest early this year is debated to be worst heatwave in history. In the website, the geographic map shows the temperature for each area from Portland, Oregon, up towards Vancouver, Canada. A new all-time record was recorded in the western province of Canada. In summary, the project found that the heatwave could not have been caused solely by nature. Two main possible factors of the heatwave are the current climate change crisis, which includes 1.2 Celcius of global warming, as well as a nonlinear interaction in the climate where it has substantially increased the probability of such extreme heat.

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
  - We hope to find the correlation between the increase in electrical vehicle usage and the carbon emission in the transportation sector towards our environment.
  - We also would like to see if the implemented transportation policy by the government could actually have a positive effect towards our local area. For example, the correlation could be observed in the increase of EV usage after the certain policy, compared to the gas emission in the state by year.
  - We would like to know how our human activities specifically in the transportation sector could contribute towards the global climate change. Since PNW is a small area compared to the world, we would like to know how much of the global climate change is caused by our local area.

## Finding Data

### Dataset 1
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
  - [Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer](https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/index.html#transportation/entiresector/allgas/category/all)
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
  - Data was collected by the EPA annually. Dataset includes data about how much carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere per year by different categories (fossil fuels, fluorinated gasses, etc)
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
  - 29
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
  - 6
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - How much of total US greenhouse gasses are released by cars with internal combustion engines. How much emissions could be saved by taking them off the road and replacing them with electric vehicles.

### Dataset 2
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
  - [CO2 Emissions by Vehicle](https://www.kaggle.com/debajyotipodder/co2-emission-by-vehicles?select=CO2+Emissions_Canada.csv)
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
  - The data was collected by the Canadian government and it is collected annually, although this data is from one particular year. This data is aout the CO2 emissions of different models of cars in one year.   
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
  - 7385
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
  - 12 
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
  - Which vehicles emit less CO2 in terms of their model, transmission, and fuel type? Which of these vehicles are becoming more or less common over the years? 

### Dataset 3
- Where did you download the data (e.g., a web URL)?
- How was the data collected or generated? Make sure to explain who collected the data (not necessarily the same people that host the data), and who or what the data is about?
- How many observations (rows) are in your data?
- How many features (columns) are in the data?
- What questions (from above) can be answered using the data in this dataset?
