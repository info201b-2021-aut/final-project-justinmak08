# Project Proposal

This is where you will create your Github repo for your final project. Instructions are on Canvas!


## Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?
 - Our domain of interest is related to environment field around the area of Pacific Northwest. We choose to observe the carbon footprint by the human activities that lead towards greenhouse impact in our local area. As example, specifically how the automotive or motor-operated vehicle impact our local environment? Could the change towards electric vehicle reduce the impact of carbon emission?. We will make a hypothesis based on the data collected and derive the impact of transportation over years on the environment.
- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

  - One of the data driven project is the Forest Fire in Pacific Northwest. In the website, they trying to research why the wildfire around Pacific Northwest have increased over the years and how the wildfire have changed or developed because of climate changes. The data presentation show the cumulative area burned due to climate change and without climate change from 1985 to 2015. Beside, the website present the fires and climate feed loop which showed how the cycle between wildfire and our climate change will resulted to more uncontrollable fires in the future. Nonetheless, the impact towards the wildlife due to climate changes and bad forest management will resulted towards more displaced wildlife and future extinction.

  - Next, [Inventory of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18140.pdf) is a data driven project where they track the CO2 emissions by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This tracking is necessary in order to improve and initiate more policy in order to reduce the carbon footprints by the Laboratory. The project showed in deep how the calculations in each sector that emitted CO2. The result showed the most contributor to carbon footprints comes from business travel followed by natural gas consumption, employess commuting and purchased electricity.
