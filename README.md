# Project Proposal

This is where you will create your Github repo for your final project. Instructions are on Canvas!


## Domain of Interest
- Why are you interested in this field/domain?
 - Our domain of interest is related to environment field around the area of Pacific Northwest. We choose to observe the carbon footprint by the human activities that lead towards greenhouse impact in our local area. As example, specifically how the automotive or motor-operated vehicle impact our local environment? Could the change towards electric vehicle reduce the impact of carbon emission?. We will make a hypothesis based on the data collected and derive the impact of transportation over years on the environment.
- What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?

  - One of the data driven project is the Forest Fire in Pacific Northwest. In the website, they trying to research why the wildfire around Pacific Northwest have increased over the years and how the wildfire have changed or developed because of climate changes. The data presentation show the cumulative area burned due to climate change and without climate change from 1985 to 2015. Beside, the website present the fires and climate feed loop which showed how the cycle between wildfire and our climate change will resulted to more uncontrollable fires in the future. Nonetheless, the impact towards the wildlife due to climate changes and bad forest management will resulted towards more displaced wildlife and future extinction.

  - Next, [Inventory of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Emissions at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory](https://www.pnnl.gov/main/publications/external/technical_reports/PNNL-18140.pdf) is a data driven project where they track the CO2 emissions by the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. This tracking is necessary in order to improve and initiate more policy in order to reduce the carbon footprints by the Laboratory. The project showed in deep how the calculations in each sector that emitted CO2. The result showed the most contributor to carbon footprints comes from business travel followed by natural gas consumption, employees commuting and purchased electricity.

  -  [Western North American extreme heat virtually impossible without human-caused climate change](https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/) is a data driven research to find the cause of the recent heatwave in Western North America. The recent extreme heatwave in Pacific Northwest early this year is debated to be worst heatwave in history. In the website, the geographic map showed the temperature for each area from Portland, Oregan towards Vancouver, Canada. A new all-time record was recorded in western province of Canada. As summary, the project found that the heatwave will be impossible to be cause solely by nature factor. Two main possible factors of the heatwave are the current climate change which includes 1.2 Celcius of global warming and a nonlinear interactions in the climate where it have substantially increased the probability of such extreme heat.

- What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?
  - We hope to find the correlation between the increase in the electrical vehicle usage and the carbon emission in the transportation sector towards our environment.
  - We also would like to see if the implemented transportation policy by the government could actually give a positive effect towards our local area. As example, the correlation could be observe in the increase of EV usage after certain policy compared to the gas emission in the state by year.
  - We would like to know how our human activities specifically in the transportation sector could contribute towards the global climate change. Since PNW is a small area compared to the world, we would like to know how much of the global climate change are caused by our local area.
